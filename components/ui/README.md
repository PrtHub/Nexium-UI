## UI Components

This directory contains all the base UI components of the NexiumUI library.

Each component should:
1. Have its own directory
2. Include the main component file
3. Include tests
4. Include types
5. Include stories (if using Storybook)

Example structure:
```
button/
├── button.tsx
├── button.test.tsx
├── button.types.ts
└── button.stories.tsx
```
