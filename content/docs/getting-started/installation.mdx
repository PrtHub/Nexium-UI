# Installation

NexiumUI is a copy-paste UI component library, which means you don't need to install it as a package. Instead, you'll need to set up the following dependencies to use the components effectively:

## 1. Create Next.js Project

First, create a new Next.js project with TypeScript

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

## 2. Install Additional Dependencies

Install these additional dependencies for enhanced functionality:

```bash
npm install clsx tailwind-merge class-variance-authority lucide-react
```

## 3. Setup Utility Functions

Create a new file called `lib/utils.ts` and add the following code:

```tsx
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

## 4. Configure Tailwind CSS

Add the following to your `tailwind.config.ts` file:

```tsx
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  darkMode: ["class"],
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("tailwindcss-animate")],
};
export default config;
```

## 5. Start Using Components

Now you're ready to start copying and pasting components from our library into your project.
Each component page includes the full source code and usage examples.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> When copying components, make sure to also copy any required dependencies or utility functions mentioned in the component's documentation.
